      <description>I seem to be doing a bunch of rewrites of my older projects nowadays. But sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s necessary. It is for the case of duplex (and libduplex).
Background When I was working at DigitalOcean over the past summer, my main project was a communication framework called duplex. Duplex&amp;rsquo;s aim was to create a simple messaging framework that could potentially be used for RPC. The first version was prototyped in Go, and I created libdpx, which was the first version in C.</description>

      <description>Most people have heard of debugging tools like gdb. For the rest, it&amp;rsquo;s usually just continuous testing and catching problems with your eye. But sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s not that simple.
Take for example (and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this example a lot), libdpx. I was trying to clean up the code for the past two days, but when I moved a simple statement that should work, everything essentially went to hell. You can see that commit here.</description>
