      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a bit eerie to learn that I last updated this two years ago.
In a way, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been surprised; 2016 was a hectic year for me, whether it was making sure that I passed my classes outstandingly (and mostly succeeded), or looking at jobs (spoiler - I just passed my one year mark at Amazon, excluding my internship), apartment hunting, time with friends, Overwatch coming out, and just general travelling&amp;hellip; despite the fact that my blog was always on my laptop I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the motivation to pull it out and update it.</description>
