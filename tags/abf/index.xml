      <description>This one was the one that needed the obvious rewrite.
Background Kahinah is an updates manager for the OpenMandriva Association&amp;rsquo;s distribution, OpenMandriva Lx. Its goal is to monitor builds that are produced from a build system (which is abf.io right now), and create a karma system which testers can vote on the updates, and eventually accept them as working, or reject them as deficient.
This worked for the most part, but when it came time for a large number of builds (think a KDE SC 4 version update), Kahinah was overwhelmed, testers were crushed, and updates had a hard time going through.</description>
