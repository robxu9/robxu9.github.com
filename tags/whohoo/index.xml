      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering why all the posts have suddenly appeared, the answer is that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally achieved peak boredom level that I need to write on my blog again.
That was quick. I just flew in from Seattle today.
So if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious from the description, I just finished an internship this past week. I already find myself wishing I could be back at my internship with Amazon - it was amazing!</description>
