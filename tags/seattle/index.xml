      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering why all the posts have suddenly appeared, the answer is
that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally achieved peak boredom level that I need to write on my blog
again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was quick. I just flew in from Seattle today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious from the description, I just finished an internship
this past week. I already find myself wishing I could be back at my internship
with Amazon - it was amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with Fulfillment by Amazon on Global Selling - and what an experience!
It gave me the insight into how to interact with business and develop solutions
that make sense, are maintainable, and can provide long term reliability. I got
a lot of good advice and criticism, and I would be lying if I said I didn&amp;rsquo;t
want to work there again - I&amp;rsquo;d love to. (But I&amp;rsquo;m doing a MBA programme that
will take next year&amp;rsquo;s summer away from me&amp;hellip; ARGH. HARD CHOICES)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seattle itself was wonderful. I think the key thing here is that it&amp;rsquo;s not hot
as hell the majority of the time, it&amp;rsquo;s a relaxing place, and it&amp;rsquo;s not humid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not humid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you realise how strange that is, coming from the east coast? It&amp;rsquo;s
mind-boggling. This past week was around the mid-60s and lower-70s - what great
weather!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, the general environment is great, the traffic is &lt;em&gt;loads&lt;/em&gt; better
than the east coast (I-5 is bad? Hah. Haven&amp;rsquo;t seen I-95, huh?), and it&amp;rsquo;s such a
nice place to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a bunch of cool roomies too, which made it even better. Made a lot of cool
friends &amp;ndash; wonder if we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to keep in touch. It&amp;rsquo;d definitely be fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, completely worth the experience. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; would do again, but &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; maybe
shouldn&amp;rsquo;t use ABODA. I think I might want to rent next time I go there. (But
then again, all the interns were in one place&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr A+ would do again&lt;/p&gt;
