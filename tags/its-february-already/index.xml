      <description>That was quick.
What have I been up to? Things I&amp;rsquo;ve done lately include:
 studying for CSE 320, which is System Architecture. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m slow on the uptake with this class, whatnot with muxes and ALUs&amp;hellip;
 working on CSE 306, which is implementing a simple grep without libc. So just Linux system calls. Not bad, just time consuming. Also I gave up trying to make descriptive errors and just dumped errno.</description>
