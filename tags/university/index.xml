      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ah, December. The time of year where there&amp;rsquo;s a surprising lack of snow on the
ground, finals are over surprisingly early, and time for pondering life has
become plentiful. Which brings me to pondering life and my decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What on earth am I doing? Where will I be after I graduate? What do I want to
do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial thought was to go and try to pursue a MBA, because that&amp;rsquo;s useful and
all, but somewhere along the line I saw all the applications and became less
enthusiastic. Then I thought about the possibility that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get into
graduate school because I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough work experience, and lo and behold,
I&amp;rsquo;m searching for jobs again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(To Eric, my mentor at Amazon: you&amp;rsquo;re right, you win.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But really, &lt;strong&gt;what am I doing?&lt;/strong&gt; I think the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m graduating early has
me stuttering a bit, because that&amp;rsquo;s something big and not ordinary by any means.
I was going to brush it off by saying I&amp;rsquo;d pad that year out with the MBA, but
the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m stuttering on even that has made me realise that I really
should stop and think, and not mindlessly toil through the semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mum suggested that I should do a dual math major; I responded by pointing
out that I&amp;rsquo;d still graduate a semester early because that only pads out
how many credits by about 4-5 courses. So it doesn&amp;rsquo;t solve the lingering
thoughts in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still haven&amp;rsquo;t answered the question, so I suppose I should do that first.
I&amp;rsquo;m trying to complete my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science in an exemplary
way. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to rush through it (though, I suppose in some aspects I
already have), and I want good grades in CS, damnit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where will I be after I graduate?&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t know. Amazon&amp;rsquo;s a possibility; but
I never really had time to think about it this semester. (Note to self: do not
take so many project courses at once.) Enrolling into graduate school is another
possibility. I have to do a bunch of job applications, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, all possibilities, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. &lt;em&gt;And that uncertainty is killing
me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there&amp;rsquo;s only one way to find out, I suppose. Time to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do I want to do?&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I want to program, of course. Whether I want to
work at a startup, at a major company, work on my own projects, etc&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not
too sure right now. But hey, I guess it all builds up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the end of this blog post is still &amp;ldquo;what am I even doing&amp;rdquo;. In the end, though,
I suppose that&amp;rsquo;s how it&amp;rsquo;ll always be.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Long story short:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSE 306: Operating Systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSE 312: Ethics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSE 320: System Architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MEC 280: Pollution &amp;amp; Human Health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CCS 202: Film Genres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I survive.&lt;/p&gt;
