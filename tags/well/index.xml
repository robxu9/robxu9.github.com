      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s weird to think that only a few semesters ago, I was starting university. But as I went into my advisor last week and sat down and went over my coursework and transcript, I noticed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how many more classes I needed.
So we both sat down and analysed what I had left to take, and what I was planning to take. And we both came to the conclusion that I would be graduating one year early.</description>
