      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a bit eerie to learn that I last updated this two years ago.
In a way, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been surprised; 2016 was a hectic year for me, whether it was making sure that I passed my classes outstandingly (and mostly succeeded), or looking at jobs (spoiler - I just passed my one year mark at Amazon, excluding my internship), apartment hunting, time with friends, Overwatch coming out, and just general travelling&amp;hellip; despite the fact that my blog was always on my laptop I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the motivation to pull it out and update it.</description>

      <title>do cleanups, not rewrites</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had an application that&amp;rsquo;s been going on for about 3 years now. Kahinah was built to manage package updates for OpenMandriva Lx. I wrote it, did incremental updates to it, declared it a horrible mess and that I would rewrite it. Then never touched it for nearly two years.
The problem with rewrites is that you&amp;rsquo;re going into the mentality that you&amp;rsquo;re going to throw away all your code and restart from scratch; consequently, you can redo the whole structure of your app, make it all nice, neat, and everything looks nice.</description>

      <description>Ah, December. The time of year where there&amp;rsquo;s a surprising lack of snow on the ground, finals are over surprisingly early, and time for pondering life has become plentiful. Which brings me to pondering life and my decisions.
What on earth am I doing? Where will I be after I graduate? What do I want to do?
My initial thought was to go and try to pursue a MBA, because that&amp;rsquo;s useful and all, but somewhere along the line I saw all the applications and became less enthusiastic.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering why all the posts have suddenly appeared, the answer is that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally achieved peak boredom level that I need to write on my blog again.
That was quick. I just flew in from Seattle today.
So if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious from the description, I just finished an internship this past week. I already find myself wishing I could be back at my internship with Amazon - it was amazing!</description>

      <description>So.
Over the past two months I have expanded my domain acquisitions. I now own rxu.io and rxu.tech, but I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly have too much of a clue with what to do with them. Yet.
I&amp;rsquo;m thinking that I&amp;rsquo;ll be making rxu.io my personal homepage site - some nice one page with links to all my profiles, resumes, this blog, etc; and rxu.tech a listing of projects that I am or were involved with.</description>

      <description>long time no see, blog.
nothing new on the music front - I did listen to a lot of BBC Radio 1 and Capital FM London, though. So most of my music from these past few months come from there.
Honestly, I think I was just really lazy to go and find really new and fresh music. That might have been because my apartment-mate for the summer, Theo, had a bunch of interesting music on him.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s weird to think that only a few semesters ago, I was starting university. But as I went into my advisor last week and sat down and went over my coursework and transcript, I noticed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how many more classes I needed.
So we both sat down and analysed what I had left to take, and what I was planning to take. And we both came to the conclusion that I would be graduating one year early.</description>

      <description>I got Spotify Premium this month! So everything I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to is in my Spotify playlist.
A criticism of Spotify here - your new client sucks. It takes up double the memory, meaning I can&amp;rsquo;t run it and use my Linux VM, I can&amp;rsquo;t Ctrl-F through my playlist anymore, and your playlist has started to remove tracks on its own.
Not cool. I don&amp;rsquo;t like tracks disappearing from my playlist because they&amp;rsquo;re either local files or unplayable on this computer.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s spring break, and it&amp;rsquo;s nice to finally have a week to kind of relax and not worry about midterms as much (of course, I&amp;rsquo;m ignoring the fact that I have a midterm in CSE306/Operating Systems next week), but it also gives the chance to reflect and ask, &amp;ldquo;what the hell went wrong on Friday?&amp;rdquo;
Friday was my CSE320/Computer Organization &amp;amp; Architecture midterm - a midterm that currently has a 43% average and what the professor called &amp;ldquo;dismal scores across the board&amp;rdquo;: so where did it all go wrong?</description>

      <description>My website was just cloudflare&amp;rsquo;d today.
In a nutshell, this means that I&amp;rsquo;ve switched nameservers (again), from DigitalOcean to CloudFlare. The main reason for that is because of CloudFlare&amp;rsquo;s free https support, which I use in tandem with Github Pages.
(Yes, no https on robxu9.com severely irked me.)
Additionally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with new mail hosting lately, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been switching mail providers like&amp;hellip; every other week. Still self hosting in the end, but I just wanted to remark on a few things:</description>

      <description>One of my more boring months. Other than the following, I&amp;rsquo;ve just been listening to BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, Captial FM London, FRESH 102.7, or HOT 99.5&amp;hellip;
 The Script - a still amazing band, with their song &amp;ldquo;Man on a Wire&amp;rdquo;.
 BoA - because I can&amp;rsquo;t have a normal playlist without some J-Pop or K-Pop - although, the K-Pop is relatively recent, and I still prefer J-Pop.</description>

      <description>That was quick.
What have I been up to? Things I&amp;rsquo;ve done lately include:
 studying for CSE 320, which is System Architecture. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m slow on the uptake with this class, whatnot with muxes and ALUs&amp;hellip;
 working on CSE 306, which is implementing a simple grep without libc. So just Linux system calls. Not bad, just time consuming. Also I gave up trying to make descriptive errors and just dumped errno.</description>

      <description>This one was the one that needed the obvious rewrite.
Background Kahinah is an updates manager for the OpenMandriva Association&amp;rsquo;s distribution, OpenMandriva Lx. Its goal is to monitor builds that are produced from a build system (which is abf.io right now), and create a karma system which testers can vote on the updates, and eventually accept them as working, or reject them as deficient.
This worked for the most part, but when it came time for a large number of builds (think a KDE SC 4 version update), Kahinah was overwhelmed, testers were crushed, and updates had a hard time going through.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a bunch of new things lately:
 PVRIS - a relatively new band that I discovered via BBC radio one. they have really great songs, especially &amp;ldquo;My House&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;St. Patrick&amp;rdquo;. It feels a bit like Paramore, although the sound is much more edgy.
 30 Seconds To Mars - I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to them for a while now actually, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten tired of their songs yet.</description>

      <guid>https://www.robxu9.com/2015/01/duplex-in-c-take-two/</guid>
      <description>I seem to be doing a bunch of rewrites of my older projects nowadays. But sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s necessary. It is for the case of duplex (and libduplex).
Background When I was working at DigitalOcean over the past summer, my main project was a communication framework called duplex. Duplex&amp;rsquo;s aim was to create a simple messaging framework that could potentially be used for RPC. The first version was prototyped in Go, and I created libdpx, which was the first version in C.</description>

      <description>I never had the time to really blog about things in length after I left DigitalOcean. I guess I felt like it was time consuming and such effort could better be spent sleeping or coding or something along the lines of that.
But then school came around and I was thrown into the chaos that is the fall semester of university, and I never had a chance to step back from all the craziness that followed and put my thoughts together.</description>

      <description>Most people have heard of debugging tools like gdb. For the rest, it&amp;rsquo;s usually just continuous testing and catching problems with your eye. But sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s not that simple.
Take for example (and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this example a lot), libdpx. I was trying to clean up the code for the past two days, but when I moved a simple statement that should work, everything essentially went to hell. You can see that commit here.</description>

      <description>Reading or writing any sort of stream can be slow. I cannot stress how much that is true.
It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly noticeable, especially when you have some sort of GUI program in debug mode and it prints out a load of stuff. Each printout, whether it&amp;rsquo;s piped somewhere else or goes to the console, can add time that matters to your program&amp;rsquo;s execution.
Why bring it up now? Take for example, libdpx.</description>

      <guid>https://www.robxu9.com/2014/07/ctypes-why/</guid>
      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t claim to be a particularly good Python programmer at all. I&amp;rsquo;m probably one of the&amp;hellip; less useful people to program Python - I much prefer Go (and to be rather honest, C).
But I think I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered the nastiest piece of library I&amp;rsquo;ve used with Python - ctypes.
What is ctypes? It&amp;rsquo;s kind of like the psuedo C package for Go - it allows direct access to C functions and structures and all those nice things, and lets you use C libraries in your Python program.</description>

      <description>Welp, I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s about time that I made an actual blog on my actual domain. Whee!
I made a list of projects I wanted to do in the future - kinda like my personal project collection. When I actually compiled the list, though, it started to become a bit unrealistic.
 uitest - UI testing via VNC connection gomq - MineQuest, written in Go kahinah - OpenMandriva&amp;rsquo;s QA Bot, which needs a rewrite (codenamed v4) aye - a DO API client in Go (like tugboat) gnome 3.</description>

      <description>Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m Robert. Supposedly an about page is supposed to be a window into a person&amp;rsquo;s world. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s a horrifying thought, so let&amp;rsquo;s make sure never to go down there.
Instead, let me tell you about myself. New Yorker for the first half of my childhood; Marylander for the second half. Graduated with a BS in Computer Science from Stony Brook University (2013-2016!), and now I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer at Amazon.</description>
