      <title>where have I been all summer?</title>
      <link>https://www.robxu9.com/2015/08/where-have-i-been-all-summer/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering why all the posts have suddenly appeared, the answer is
that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally achieved peak boredom level that I need to write on my blog
again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was quick. I just flew in from Seattle today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious from the description, I just finished an internship
this past week. I already find myself wishing I could be back at my internship
with Amazon - it was amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with Fulfillment by Amazon on Global Selling - and what an experience!
It gave me the insight into how to interact with business and develop solutions
that make sense, are maintainable, and can provide long term reliability. I got
a lot of good advice and criticism, and I would be lying if I said I didn&amp;rsquo;t
want to work there again - I&amp;rsquo;d love to. (But I&amp;rsquo;m doing a MBA programme that
will take next year&amp;rsquo;s summer away from me&amp;hellip; ARGH. HARD CHOICES)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seattle itself was wonderful. I think the key thing here is that it&amp;rsquo;s not hot
as hell the majority of the time, it&amp;rsquo;s a relaxing place, and it&amp;rsquo;s not humid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not humid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you realise how strange that is, coming from the east coast? It&amp;rsquo;s
mind-boggling. This past week was around the mid-60s and lower-70s - what great
weather!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, the general environment is great, the traffic is &lt;em&gt;loads&lt;/em&gt; better
than the east coast (I-5 is bad? Hah. Haven&amp;rsquo;t seen I-95, huh?), and it&amp;rsquo;s such a
nice place to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a bunch of cool roomies too, which made it even better. Made a lot of cool
friends &amp;ndash; wonder if we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to keep in touch. It&amp;rsquo;d definitely be fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, completely worth the experience. &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; would do again, but &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; maybe
shouldn&amp;rsquo;t use ABODA. I think I might want to rent next time I go there. (But
then again, all the interns were in one place&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr A+ would do again&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>new domains</title>
      <link>https://www.robxu9.com/2015/08/new-domains/</link>

      <guid>https://www.robxu9.com/2015/08/new-domains/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two months I have expanded my domain acquisitions. I now own
&lt;strong&gt;rxu.io&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;rxu.tech&lt;/strong&gt;, but I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly have too much of a clue with
what to do with them. Yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m thinking that I&amp;rsquo;ll be making &lt;strong&gt;rxu.io&lt;/strong&gt; my personal homepage site - some
nice one page with links to all my profiles, resumes, this blog, etc; and
&lt;strong&gt;rxu.tech&lt;/strong&gt; a listing of projects that I am or were involved with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I am completely open to other ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>may, june, july, and august music</title>
      <link>https://www.robxu9.com/2015/08/may-june-july-and-august-music/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;long time no see, blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nothing new on the music front - I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; listen to a lot of BBC Radio 1 and
Capital FM London, though. So most of my music from these past few months come
from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I think I was just really lazy to go and find really new and fresh music.
That might have been because my apartment-mate for the summer, Theo, had a bunch of
interesting music on him. Though a lot of it is rap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For simplicity, I&amp;rsquo;ve just gone ahead and embedded Spotify playlists below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laziness prevails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Arobxu9%3Aplaylist%3A6mWZecZCQyrXzHjeTbfGg1&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

      <title>graduating early</title>
      <link>https://www.robxu9.com/2015/04/graduating-early/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2015 16:32:50 -0400</pubDate>
      <author>me@robxu9.com (Robert Xu)</author>
      <guid>https://www.robxu9.com/2015/04/graduating-early/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s weird to think that only a few semesters ago, I was starting university.
But as I went into my advisor last week and sat down and went over my
coursework and transcript, I noticed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how many more classes
I needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we both sat down and analysed what I had left to take, and what I was
planning to take. And we both came to the conclusion that I would be graduating
&lt;strong&gt;one year early&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people can only dream of doing this, and especially in Computer Science,
courses are rigirous enough to discourage people from taking too many classes
at one time, lest they be burnt grade-wise. (&lt;em&gt;stares at cse320&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for some reason, it worked out that I had 36 credits left to take - or 12
classes. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing 5 classes per semester, not wanting to stress myself
out, but it looks like with 12 classes left, that&amp;rsquo;s about 2 semesters or 3
semesters, depending on how it&amp;rsquo;s partitioned. (There is an option to do
6-5-1, where the last credit is taken in the summer session and I graduate
officially in August, even though I go to the May ceremony, but I&amp;rsquo;m opting
to do the last credit before, so it&amp;rsquo;s 1-6-5.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And especially since I&amp;rsquo;m out of state, an additional semester isn&amp;rsquo;t really
worth it only for 4 classes money-wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a couple of options ahead of me. I guess I should start putting 2016
instead of 2017 in my graduation date for job applications, and I guess I should
look and see what I have in store for myself. Like, I want to get a degree for
a MBA in the near future, so maybe I could work on the MBA and graduate in 2017,
but it&amp;rsquo;s still all up in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many choices. So many decisions. I&amp;rsquo;m scared I&amp;rsquo;ll make the wrong one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should update my resume. I lost my resume document, except I still have the
PDF, so I guess I have to recreate it&amp;hellip; again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got Spotify Premium this month! So everything I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to is
in my Spotify playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A criticism of Spotify here - your new client sucks. It takes up double
the memory, meaning I can&amp;rsquo;t run it and use my Linux VM, I can&amp;rsquo;t Ctrl-F through
my playlist anymore, and your playlist has started to remove tracks on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not cool. I don&amp;rsquo;t like tracks disappearing from my playlist because they&amp;rsquo;re
either local files or unplayable on &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I had to downgrade. (grumble grumble)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But yeah, here&amp;rsquo;s my Spotify playlist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:robxu9:playlist:778rq3pUydczAVd7iPmNob&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

      <title>and now for something completely different</title>
      <link>https://www.robxu9.com/2015/03/and-now-for-something-completely-different/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s spring break, and it&amp;rsquo;s nice to finally have a week to kind of relax and
not worry about midterms as much (of course, I&amp;rsquo;m ignoring the fact that I have
a midterm in CSE306/Operating Systems next week), but it also gives the chance
to reflect and ask, &amp;ldquo;what the hell went wrong on Friday?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday was my CSE320/Computer Organization &amp;amp; Architecture midterm - a midterm
that currently has a 43% average and what the professor called &amp;ldquo;dismal scores
across the board&amp;rdquo;: so where did it all go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of debate recently in our class about what lengths a teacher
should go to help their students. I personally think that our professor is
doing a fine job, despite my own past grievances against her. She&amp;rsquo;s been
releasing practice problems, despite being under no obligation to do so; and
they&amp;rsquo;ve been helpful. Having TAs help our class (even though our class
should technically have no TAs) has also been a huge help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while I seem to be satisfied, there are others who are starting to actively
rally the class against her teaching skills, despite the fact that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t
seem like many other of her previous classes have had as much trouble. So is it
just our class?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-difficult-question-of-what-teachers-should-be-doing:80f5062d88d9dcfdb5f1da7e32750f76&#34;&gt;The difficult question of what teachers should be doing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These teachers have a difficult job. Given a class of anywhere from 30 to 200
students (and even more for general education classes, where lecture halls
quickly fill to 500-1000 students), they have the insurmountable task of
teaching every single one of those students the skills they need to move on
to the next class. It&amp;rsquo;s sometimes an almost impossible task, regardless of the
class size, and yet they still plow on every single semester and try their
best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers are the best, simply for looking up in the face of all this pressure,
giving it the middle finger, and then proceeding (most of the time) to smash
expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work out? Teachers have readily gone out of their way
to provide extra material in the form of practice problems, review sessions,
lab sessions, better homework software, and more - and they&amp;rsquo;re not exactly
paid to do that, either. They could easily tell you that the textbook was
required for the course, so read the textbook and figure it out on your own
and stop by office hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, they go out of their way to do a whole lot more whenever possible,
and make sure that learning centres are open for other students to help as
well. Basically, all avenues as open as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-moment-the-students-begin-to-expect-extra-as-normal:80f5062d88d9dcfdb5f1da7e32750f76&#34;&gt;The moment the students begin to expect extra as &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the extra material seems to get mixed up as normal material.
Then what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s where the debate is - do teachers have an obligation to continue
doing these extra things for their classes if they&amp;rsquo;ve done it in the
past, or can they simply say no if it turns out to be untenable? Does it fall
to the students to make the extra material?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(sidenote: I will say it does fall to the student to take advantage of office
hours at the very minimum and study the normal material.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no ending to this blog post, because I can&amp;rsquo;t answer this question.
Maybe someone else can. Or can&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>cloudflare&#39;d</title>
      <link>https://www.robxu9.com/2015/03/cloudflared/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2015 22:11:30 -0500</pubDate>

      <guid>https://www.robxu9.com/2015/03/cloudflared/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My website was just cloudflare&amp;rsquo;d today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, this means that I&amp;rsquo;ve switched nameservers (again), from
DigitalOcean to CloudFlare. The main reason for that is because of
CloudFlare&amp;rsquo;s free https support, which I use in tandem with Github Pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Yes, no https on robxu9.com severely irked me.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with new mail hosting lately, so
I&amp;rsquo;ve been switching mail providers like&amp;hellip; every other week. Still self
hosting in the end, but I just wanted to remark on a few things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zentyal&lt;/strong&gt;: I &lt;em&gt;really really really really really really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to
like you like Carly Rae Jepsen&amp;rsquo;s new obsession. But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t. You have a
strange number of problems, your general configuration screen doesn&amp;rsquo;t work
(&amp;ldquo;missing parameter: id&amp;rdquo;???), and it was an overall mess. But your ability
to mimic Exchange and also put together Mail, Contacts, and Calendar all
in one with OpenChange and SoGo was really appealing. Unfortunately, errors
aren&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mailinabox.email&lt;/strong&gt;: I mentioned that I wanted to use CloudFlare, right?
Mail-in-a-Box is really insistent that you use its internal DNS, and if you
don&amp;rsquo;t, add 100000000 DNS records to CloudFlare instead. That&amp;rsquo;s not really an
issue, but then bind9 refused to resolve any DNS requests, and I gave up there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;yunohost&lt;/strong&gt;: I really wish I had a picture of that meme right now. But this
is what I&amp;rsquo;m currently using now, after three weeks (Mail-in-a-Box is actually
still up on my other VPS, but that&amp;rsquo;s going down as soon as DNS propagates).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; nice to have a tiled welcome screen and something that seems to
Just Work &amp;trade; after so long. Although, I have to admit, Dovecot ran out of
epoll handlers and that left me stumped, but a reboot solved that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should go study for CSE 320 now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my more boring months. Other than the following, I&amp;rsquo;ve just been
listening to BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, Captial FM London, FRESH 102.7,
or HOT 99.5&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Script&lt;/em&gt; - a still amazing band, with their song &amp;ldquo;Man on a Wire&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BoA&lt;/em&gt; - because I can&amp;rsquo;t have a normal playlist without some J-Pop or
K-Pop - although, the K-Pop is relatively recent, and I still prefer J-Pop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OneRepublic&lt;/em&gt; - I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what &amp;ldquo;I Lived&amp;rdquo; was until
now, even though it&amp;rsquo;s been playing literally everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Guetta&lt;/em&gt; - From his album &lt;em&gt;Listen (Deluxe)&lt;/em&gt;, which I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard
really played on any radio station at all recently. But &amp;ldquo;Dangerous&amp;rdquo; and
&amp;ldquo;What I Did For Love&amp;rdquo; are really nice songs, even though &amp;ldquo;What I Did For Love&amp;rdquo;
was &amp;ldquo;very gospel&amp;rsquo;y&amp;rdquo;, according to my friend (I like it, though!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sia&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;ldquo;Elastic Heart&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Bang My Head&amp;rdquo; are two amazing songs - sure, it&amp;rsquo;s
a bit hard to understand her through her Australia accent, but you can&amp;rsquo;t deny
that her voice is amazing. And then when you realise that she doesn&amp;rsquo;t show her
face at any performance and that it&amp;rsquo;s all her voice, it just makes it all the
more remarkable at her success. You can truly appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah. Boring tracks. Recommendations? Let me know below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What have I been up to? Things I&amp;rsquo;ve done lately include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;studying for CSE 320, which is System Architecture. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m slow on
the uptake with this class, whatnot with muxes and ALUs&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;working on CSE 306, which is implementing a simple &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; without libc. So
just Linux system calls. Not bad, just time consuming. Also I gave up trying
to make descriptive errors and just dumped &lt;code&gt;errno.h&lt;/code&gt; into a switch statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should probably do the Ethics project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beat Tales of Symphonia, Tales of Symphonia: Knights of Ratatosk, and started
Tales of the Abyss, then realised that I actually have homework to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had an Amazon interview. This was my first real interview in a &lt;strong&gt;LONG&lt;/strong&gt; time,
and I&amp;rsquo;m not so certain I ace&amp;rsquo;d it. It was an experience, but it took my brain
way too long to warm up and I think that cost me. I think I missed a Big-O
notation and I definitely forgot about Kruskal&amp;rsquo;s algorithm. Shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Went to Boston for ECAASU 2015! Here&amp;rsquo;s a tip: don&amp;rsquo;t drive in Boston. The
roads make no sense whatsoever (they&amp;rsquo;re like downtown Manhattan), and the
random forks and roundabouts hurt my head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s more happening soon, but I gotta survive until at least Spring Break&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;CSE 312: Ethics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSE 320: System Architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MEC 280: Pollution &amp;amp; Human Health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CCS 202: Film Genres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I survive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This one was the one that needed the obvious rewrite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;background:226c55525206653d6c71e0f5695b4e16&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kahinah is an updates manager for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://openmandriva.org&#34;&gt;OpenMandriva&lt;/a&gt;
Association&amp;rsquo;s distribution, OpenMandriva Lx. Its goal is to monitor builds that
are produced from a build system (which is &lt;a href=&#34;https://abf.io&#34;&gt;abf.io&lt;/a&gt; right now),
and create a karma system which testers can vote on the updates, and eventually
accept them as working, or reject them as deficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This worked for the most part, but when it came time for a large number of
builds (think a KDE SC 4 version update), Kahinah was overwhelmed, testers
were crushed, and updates had a hard time going through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the system suffered from numerous bugs due to changes on abf.io,
and it certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t help that I was using &lt;a href=&#34;http://beego.me&#34;&gt;beego&lt;/a&gt; and
pulling many many dependencies, which shot build times up through the roof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;version-4:226c55525206653d6c71e0f5695b4e16&#34;&gt;Version&amp;hellip; 4?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first couple of versions were just getting it usable and bearable for the
most part. This rewrite is entirely from scratch, with no existing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally provide a decent JSON API, and I plan to use JSON web tokens to
provide authentication (thanks Matt for pointing that out). Updates are now
more organized, and for the first time ever, I&amp;rsquo;m providing a new type called
advisories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-are-advisories:226c55525206653d6c71e0f5695b4e16&#34;&gt;What are Advisories?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advisories are groups of updates. Instead of voting on one update, we create
an advisory with the updates we want to contain in it. They can range from
just one update to a group of them, and testers can test ALL of them at the
same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has two purposes - one, to force package maintainers to document more
throughly for corporate customers (for example, putting bug references so
that Kahinah can connect to Bugzilla and say, hey, here&amp;rsquo;s a possible solution
that you can test), and two, to make large updates much more manageable for
testers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also brings us in line with practically every distribution out there
that has to keep track of updates (like Fedora&amp;rsquo;s bodhi).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-else-has-changed:226c55525206653d6c71e0f5695b4e16&#34;&gt;What else has changed?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The frontend is separate from the backend, and is written with
&lt;a href=&#34;http://emberjs.com&#34;&gt;ember.js&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s my first foray into ember.js, and I&amp;rsquo;m
curious to see how it goes. The documentation is a bit random, especially since
it looks like they&amp;rsquo;re migrating towards some ES6 standards, so it&amp;rsquo;ll be
both a learning experience and a headache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;release-soon:226c55525206653d6c71e0f5695b4e16&#34;&gt;Release soon?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get stuff working, maybe. I intend to deploy a beta version to
replace the current Kahinah on jasper sometime at the end of this month
or the beginning of next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;github:226c55525206653d6c71e0f5695b4e16&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/h3&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a bunch of new things lately:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PVRIS&lt;/em&gt; - a relatively new band that I discovered via BBC radio one.
they have really great songs, especially &amp;ldquo;My House&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;St. Patrick&amp;rdquo;.
It feels a bit like Paramore, although the sound is much more edgy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;30 Seconds To Mars&lt;/em&gt; - I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to them for a while now actually,
but I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten tired of their songs yet. &amp;ldquo;Kings and Queens&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;This is
War&amp;rdquo; top my playlist for January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paramore&lt;/em&gt; - Still on my playlist. But just &amp;ldquo;Part II&amp;rdquo;, now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Calvin Harris feat. Ellie Goulding&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;ldquo;Outside&amp;rdquo; is the newest of the Calvin
Harris and Ellie Goulding combos, with a more negative light on relationships
in the lyrics. I wonder if that had anything to do with both of their breakups?
Nevertheless, an enjoyable song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fall Out Boy&lt;/em&gt; - &amp;ldquo;Centuries&amp;rdquo;, which is becoming the most overplayed song on
every single radio station in the New York area. Can&amp;rsquo;t deny it&amp;rsquo;s catchy, but
it&amp;rsquo;s getting tiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ayumi Hamasaki&lt;/em&gt; - This is because I recently played through Tales of Xillia
and Tales of Xilla 2, both of which are outstanding games (though I enjoyed
Xillia 2 more because it actually made me cry). &amp;ldquo;progress&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Song 4 u&amp;rdquo; are
the opening songs of both of those games respectively, and I like the way
especially in &amp;ldquo;progress&amp;rdquo; that the instrumentals were played. Screw the lyrics,
the force in that sound!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BUMP OF CHICKEN&lt;/em&gt; - I also played Tales of the Abyss recently (though not as
recently as Tales of Xillia (2)), and since I had Hamasaki&amp;rsquo;s songs on my phone,
I thought, why not? Let&amp;rsquo;s add &amp;ldquo;ã«ã«ã&amp;rdquo; to that, too. (That&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;KARMA&amp;rdquo; in
English.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Song recomendations? Soundcloud things I should listen to? Let me know in the
comments below!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>duplex in C, take two</title>
      <link>https://www.robxu9.com/2015/01/duplex-in-c-take-two/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I seem to be doing a bunch of rewrites of my older projects nowadays. But
sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s necessary. It is for the case of duplex (and libduplex).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;background:dbd361d9d83ece52b494a1b526aef755&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was working at DigitalOcean over the past summer, my main project was
a communication framework called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/progrium/duplex&#34;&gt;duplex&lt;/a&gt;.
Duplex&amp;rsquo;s aim was to create a simple messaging framework that could potentially
be used for RPC. The first version was prototyped in Go, and I created
&lt;code&gt;libdpx&lt;/code&gt;, which was the first version in C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;code&gt;libdpx&lt;/code&gt; had some major flaws - I didn&amp;rsquo;t use a proper build
system, I used &lt;code&gt;libtask&lt;/code&gt; for coroutines (switching that out with &lt;code&gt;lthread&lt;/code&gt;,
then switching back to &lt;code&gt;libtask&lt;/code&gt; after &lt;code&gt;lthread&lt;/code&gt; didn&amp;rsquo;t work with shared
libraries), and in general I didn&amp;rsquo;t manage memory well. You could lose data
along the way with the race conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff realised that a lot of the things we wanted to implement with duplex
would be hard, because essentially we were creating a new protocol. So
recently, he took to creating a second version in Go, but this time
sitting on top of the SSH protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SSH protocol provides a bunch of the logic so that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to
worry about it - authentication, security, and channel management. This
was our way of wrapping it in a user friendly form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;libduplex:dbd361d9d83ece52b494a1b526aef755&#34;&gt;libduplex&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;libduplex&lt;/code&gt; is the second version of duplex in C. However, this time, I&amp;rsquo;m
being extra careful to, essentially, not fuck up the threading. This time
there are no lightweight coroutines or &lt;code&gt;libtask&lt;/code&gt;; instead, I directly call
pthreads in order to manage calls. The API is still threadsafe, and I still
run a thread dedicated to each ssh session (because libssh does not support
multiple threads working on sessions, which is understandable given the
complexity of the task - but it does have a non-blocking mode, and I rely
on that). Currently you can bind to tcp and unix sockets, and if any other
reliable protocol becomes available, I will gladly implement that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intent behind this is to make the Go version and C version be fully
compatible. I will not &lt;code&gt;cgo&lt;/code&gt; these bindings this time, because that seems
like a poor idea if they&amp;rsquo;re both going to be the same - the pure Go version
would work better in Go. However, there is an interest in making a Python
version for libduplex, which I will get around to after &lt;code&gt;libduplex&lt;/code&gt; is
fully compatible with the already existing Go counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;managing-time:dbd361d9d83ece52b494a1b526aef755&#34;&gt;Managing Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last duplex suffered immensely from a lack of manpower - Jeff has his
own projects and clients to focus on, and I have university which I have
to concentrate on. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t intend to abandon this at all - if
possible, I&amp;rsquo;d like this second version to become the main version of duplex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to take duplex further, too. Not just for standard communication
and RPC between applications, but further into plugin systems, APIs over
the internet, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I definitely want to keep working on it despite university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(You can make my life slightly easier by making pull requests.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;where-from-here:dbd361d9d83ece52b494a1b526aef755&#34;&gt;Where from here?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going from here remains to be seen. My immediate priorities are getting
libduplex off the ground so that it can be at least used in a beta state.
Maybe even declare it 1.0 if it gets to be good enough without any major
flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m heading along for the ride and I definitely want to see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;github:dbd361d9d83ece52b494a1b526aef755&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/h3&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I never had the time to really blog about things in length after I left
DigitalOcean. I guess I felt like it was time consuming and such effort could
better be spent sleeping or coding or something along the lines of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then school came around and I was thrown into the chaos that is the fall
semester of university, and I never had a chance to step back from all the
craziness that followed and put my thoughts together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now here we are. It&amp;rsquo;s 2015, almost 6 months since my last blog post.
I&amp;rsquo;ve resolved to take more time out to reflect on what&amp;rsquo;s been happening and
gather my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m therefore taking bets on how quickly this will fall apart. Minimum time
after I finish writing this post.&lt;/p&gt;
