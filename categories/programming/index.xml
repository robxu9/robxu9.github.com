      <description>I seem to be doing a bunch of rewrites of my older projects nowadays. But sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s necessary. It is for the case of duplex (and libduplex).
Background When I was working at DigitalOcean over the past summer, my main project was a communication framework called duplex. Duplex&amp;rsquo;s aim was to create a simple messaging framework that could potentially be used for RPC. The first version was prototyped in Go, and I created libdpx, which was the first version in C.</description>

      <description>Reading or writing any sort of stream can be slow. I cannot stress how much that is true.
It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly noticeable, especially when you have some sort of GUI program in debug mode and it prints out a load of stuff. Each printout, whether it&amp;rsquo;s piped somewhere else or goes to the console, can add time that matters to your program&amp;rsquo;s execution.
Why bring it up now? Take for example, libdpx.</description>
