      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s spring break, and it&amp;rsquo;s nice to finally have a week to kind of relax and not worry about midterms as much (of course, I&amp;rsquo;m ignoring the fact that I have a midterm in CSE306/Operating Systems next week), but it also gives the chance to reflect and ask, &amp;ldquo;what the hell went wrong on Friday?&amp;rdquo;
Friday was my CSE320/Computer Organization &amp;amp; Architecture midterm - a midterm that currently has a 43% average and what the professor called &amp;ldquo;dismal scores across the board&amp;rdquo;: so where did it all go wrong?</description>
