      <description>long time no see, blog.
nothing new on the music front - I did listen to a lot of BBC Radio 1 and Capital FM London, though. So most of my music from these past few months come from there.
Honestly, I think I was just really lazy to go and find really new and fresh music. That might have been because my apartment-mate for the summer, Theo, had a bunch of interesting music on him.</description>

      <description>I got Spotify Premium this month! So everything I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to is in my Spotify playlist.
A criticism of Spotify here - your new client sucks. It takes up double the memory, meaning I can&amp;rsquo;t run it and use my Linux VM, I can&amp;rsquo;t Ctrl-F through my playlist anymore, and your playlist has started to remove tracks on its own.
Not cool. I don&amp;rsquo;t like tracks disappearing from my playlist because they&amp;rsquo;re either local files or unplayable on this computer.</description>

      <description>One of my more boring months. Other than the following, I&amp;rsquo;ve just been listening to BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, Captial FM London, FRESH 102.7, or HOT 99.5&amp;hellip;
 The Script - a still amazing band, with their song &amp;ldquo;Man on a Wire&amp;rdquo;.
 BoA - because I can&amp;rsquo;t have a normal playlist without some J-Pop or K-Pop - although, the K-Pop is relatively recent, and I still prefer J-Pop.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to a bunch of new things lately:
 PVRIS - a relatively new band that I discovered via BBC radio one. they have really great songs, especially &amp;ldquo;My House&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;St. Patrick&amp;rdquo;. It feels a bit like Paramore, although the sound is much more edgy.
 30 Seconds To Mars - I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to them for a while now actually, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten tired of their songs yet.</description>
