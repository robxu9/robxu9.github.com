      <description>long time no see, blog.
nothing new on the music front - I did listen to a lot of BBC Radio 1 and Capital FM London, though. So most of my music from these past few months come from there.
Honestly, I think I was just really lazy to go and find really new and fresh music. That might have been because my apartment-mate for the summer, Theo, had a bunch of interesting music on him.</description>
