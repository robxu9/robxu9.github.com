      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s weird to think that only a few semesters ago, I was starting university. But as I went into my advisor last week and sat down and went over my coursework and transcript, I noticed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how many more classes I needed.
So we both sat down and analysed what I had left to take, and what I was planning to take. And we both came to the conclusion that I would be graduating one year early.</description>

      <description>I got Spotify Premium this month! So everything I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to is in my Spotify playlist.
A criticism of Spotify here - your new client sucks. It takes up double the memory, meaning I can&amp;rsquo;t run it and use my Linux VM, I can&amp;rsquo;t Ctrl-F through my playlist anymore, and your playlist has started to remove tracks on its own.
Not cool. I don&amp;rsquo;t like tracks disappearing from my playlist because they&amp;rsquo;re either local files or unplayable on this computer.</description>

      <description>One of my more boring months. Other than the following, I&amp;rsquo;ve just been listening to BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, Captial FM London, FRESH 102.7, or HOT 99.5&amp;hellip;
 The Script - a still amazing band, with their song &amp;ldquo;Man on a Wire&amp;rdquo;.
 BoA - because I can&amp;rsquo;t have a normal playlist without some J-Pop or K-Pop - although, the K-Pop is relatively recent, and I still prefer J-Pop.</description>

      <description>This one was the one that needed the obvious rewrite.
Background Kahinah is an updates manager for the OpenMandriva Association&amp;rsquo;s distribution, OpenMandriva Lx. Its goal is to monitor builds that are produced from a build system (which is abf.io right now), and create a karma system which testers can vote on the updates, and eventually accept them as working, or reject them as deficient.
This worked for the most part, but when it came time for a large number of builds (think a KDE SC 4 version update), Kahinah was overwhelmed, testers were crushed, and updates had a hard time going through.</description>

      <description>I never had the time to really blog about things in length after I left DigitalOcean. I guess I felt like it was time consuming and such effort could better be spent sleeping or coding or something along the lines of that.
But then school came around and I was thrown into the chaos that is the fall semester of university, and I never had a chance to step back from all the craziness that followed and put my thoughts together.</description>

      <description>Most people have heard of debugging tools like gdb. For the rest, it&amp;rsquo;s usually just continuous testing and catching problems with your eye. But sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s not that simple.
Take for example (and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this example a lot), libdpx. I was trying to clean up the code for the past two days, but when I moved a simple statement that should work, everything essentially went to hell. You can see that commit here.</description>

      <description>Welp, I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s about time that I made an actual blog on my actual domain. Whee!
I made a list of projects I wanted to do in the future - kinda like my personal project collection. When I actually compiled the list, though, it started to become a bit unrealistic.
 uitest - UI testing via VNC connection gomq - MineQuest, written in Go kahinah - OpenMandriva&amp;rsquo;s QA Bot, which needs a rewrite (codenamed v4) aye - a DO API client in Go (like tugboat) gnome 3.</description>
