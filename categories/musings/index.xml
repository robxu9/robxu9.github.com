      <description>My website was just cloudflare&amp;rsquo;d today.
In a nutshell, this means that I&amp;rsquo;ve switched nameservers (again), from DigitalOcean to CloudFlare. The main reason for that is because of CloudFlare&amp;rsquo;s free https support, which I use in tandem with Github Pages.
(Yes, no https on robxu9.com severely irked me.)
Additionally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with new mail hosting lately, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been switching mail providers like&amp;hellip; every other week. Still self hosting in the end, but I just wanted to remark on a few things:</description>

      <description>That was quick.
What have I been up to? Things I&amp;rsquo;ve done lately include:
 studying for CSE 320, which is System Architecture. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m slow on the uptake with this class, whatnot with muxes and ALUs&amp;hellip;
 working on CSE 306, which is implementing a simple grep without libc. So just Linux system calls. Not bad, just time consuming. Also I gave up trying to make descriptive errors and just dumped errno.</description>
