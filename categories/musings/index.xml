      <description>Ah, December. The time of year where there&amp;rsquo;s a surprising lack of snow on the ground, finals are over surprisingly early, and time for pondering life has become plentiful. Which brings me to pondering life and my decisions.
What on earth am I doing? Where will I be after I graduate? What do I want to do?
My initial thought was to go and try to pursue a MBA, because that&amp;rsquo;s useful and all, but somewhere along the line I saw all the applications and became less enthusiastic.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering why all the posts have suddenly appeared, the answer is that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally achieved peak boredom level that I need to write on my blog again.
That was quick. I just flew in from Seattle today.
So if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious from the description, I just finished an internship this past week. I already find myself wishing I could be back at my internship with Amazon - it was amazing!</description>

      <description>So.
Over the past two months I have expanded my domain acquisitions. I now own rxu.io and rxu.tech, but I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly have too much of a clue with what to do with them. Yet.
I&amp;rsquo;m thinking that I&amp;rsquo;ll be making rxu.io my personal homepage site - some nice one page with links to all my profiles, resumes, this blog, etc; and rxu.tech a listing of projects that I am or were involved with.</description>

      <description>My website was just cloudflare&amp;rsquo;d today.
In a nutshell, this means that I&amp;rsquo;ve switched nameservers (again), from DigitalOcean to CloudFlare. The main reason for that is because of CloudFlare&amp;rsquo;s free https support, which I use in tandem with Github Pages.
(Yes, no https on robxu9.com severely irked me.)
Additionally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with new mail hosting lately, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been switching mail providers like&amp;hellip; every other week. Still self hosting in the end, but I just wanted to remark on a few things:</description>

      <description>That was quick.
What have I been up to? Things I&amp;rsquo;ve done lately include:
 studying for CSE 320, which is System Architecture. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m slow on the uptake with this class, whatnot with muxes and ALUs&amp;hellip;
 working on CSE 306, which is implementing a simple grep without libc. So just Linux system calls. Not bad, just time consuming. Also I gave up trying to make descriptive errors and just dumped errno.</description>
